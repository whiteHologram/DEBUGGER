With turtle library of python, i made a multiplayer game called debugger who has simple physics. For this game player's aim is crash bugs
that game spread randomly at bottom of the screen, with her/his rock. Player 1 controls yellow rock with a-s-w-d keys and player 2 controls
cyan rock with arrow keys. You can't move to the right or the left if you are at the bottom of the screen. All kind of bugs give you 1 xp.
The Player who reach 15 xp wins.( I couldn't make a version for mac and linux game works only on windows unfortunately but it has 3 version
for 3 langue english,french and turkish)if you notice problems in my game or if you want more feature, please let me know them.
Debug and have fun.
